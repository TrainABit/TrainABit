### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm just starting out in the world of development and currently, I'm a student learning new things every day. Here's a bit about what I'm up to:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an exciting project: a personalized daily overview application. It integrates a calendar, weather updates, and a personal assistant to help manage your day more efficiently.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with other new developers or anyone who shares a passion for creating useful and innovative tools.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with advanced programming concepts and best practices in software development.
